# SkillWallet Submission Checklist

The 0% shown on the Workspace page is a portal completion state, not a code error. Use this order and tick each item only after saving its proof.

## Before submission

- [ ] Extract the ZIP and run the project locally.
- [ ] Create a fresh Gemini API key and keep it only in `.env` or the hosting secret settings.
- [ ] Open the website and generate one plan that shows the `Gemini` tag.
- [ ] Open `/docs` and test `POST /api/recommendations` successfully.
- [ ] Run `pytest -v` and confirm every test passes.
- [ ] Upload the complete project to a public or faculty-accessible GitHub repository.
- [ ] Deploy the FastAPI app and confirm `/api/health` returns HTTP 200.

## Final links to paste

```text
GitHub repository: ADD_LINK_HERE
Live demo: ADD_LINK_HERE
Swagger docs: ADD_LIVE_LINK_HERE/docs
```

After pasting the links, return to Workspace and refresh. If a section is still 0%, expand that section; one internal task, quiz or acknowledgement is still incomplete.
