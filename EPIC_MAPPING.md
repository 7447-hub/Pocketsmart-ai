## Functional acceptance criteria

- A valid budget request returns HTTP 200 and a list of recommendations.
- Invalid category, empty preference or out-of-range budget returns HTTP 422.
- The sum of all item amounts equals `total`.
- `total + remaining` always equals the user budget.
- Gemini output is validated before use.
- Missing key returns HTTP 503; Gemini/network failure returns HTTP 502 without a demo result.
- No secret key is returned by the health API or committed to source control.
- The frontend remains usable on mobile and desktop.
